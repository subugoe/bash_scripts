# bash_scripts

A collection of some useful bash-scripts, which I personally created or frome somebody else adopted. Obviously you can add to the collection yourself or/and replace or improve the scrtips as well.

Most of the scripts are tuned to the main user on ubuntu System, usually with user_id and group '1000'. Remember to change this to something else, if the main user on your system differs from it.

**Quick Tip** If you wish to use a script globally on your system, you may copy it `/usr/local/bin` and make sure it is executable with `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/<BASH_SCRIPT_FILE>`

Hope it is useful,
A.
